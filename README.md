# Router 1x3 Verification using UVM

## Project Overview

This project implements the **verification environment** for a **Router 1x3** using **Universal Verification Methodology (UVM)** in SystemVerilog. The router receives data from a single input port and forwards it to one of the three output ports based on control signals. The testbench ensures correctness, efficiency, and robustness of the design.

## Verification Architecture

The verification environment follows the standard UVM structure and consists of the following components:

### 1. **UVM Agent**

- **Router Agent:** Encapsulates the driver, monitor, and sequencer.
- **Router Driver:** Sends packets with control signals to the **Device Under Test (DUT)**.
- **Router Monitor:** Observes transactions and forwards them to the scoreboard.
- **Router Sequencer:** Generates test scenarios and sequences.

### 2. **UVM Environment**

- **Router Environment:** Instantiates the **Agent**, **Scoreboard**, and **Coverage Collector**.
- **Router Scoreboard:** Compares actual and expected output and Measures functional coverage to ensure verification completeness.

### 3. **UVM Testbench**

- **Router Test:** Runs different test cases for various routing scenarios.

## Test Scenarios

The following test cases are implemented:

### âœ… **Basic Packet Transmission:**

- Verify correct routing to output ports based on control signals.

### âœ… **Back-to-Back Transactions:**

- Ensure no data loss or corruption in continuous packet transmission.

### âœ… **Boundary Conditions:**

- Check behavior when the router operates at max load.

### âœ… **Randomized Stimulus Testing:**

- Send packets with random control signals and validate correctness.

### âœ… **Error Injection Testing:**

- Verify DUT behavior under faulty conditions (e.g., parity errors, invalid control signals).
